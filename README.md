# HPDDM
High-Pressure Data Driven Methods
The high-pressure data-driven methods (referred to as HPDDM) used in this study are implemented in Python and provided in a separate repository: https://github.com/marc-bernades/HPDDM. This package includes class definitions and functionalities for: (i) the data-driven resolvent operator; (ii) FFT-based phase speed gating and generation of flow-field slices and movies; and (ii) POD techniques for mode extraction, eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis, and reconstruction of flow fields and energetic structures.
Furthermore, this package contains the related clips of gated phase speed-based structures for a transcritical turbulent channel flow at several phase speeds in viscous and outer units coloured by streamwise and density flucutations.
